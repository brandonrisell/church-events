# Church Events

Playground app for learning ruby on rails.

This app will provide a way for churches to create events that their congregation can sign up for.

## Development

I'm utilizing VSCode's remote dev container and Docker to build a local dev environment. This way I can work on this regardless of host machine environment.

I really like the idea of the rails application not being in the root, and instead being within a `rails` directory, with another directory for a frontend web app. This would require more complex build pipelines, so I'm going to stick to a rails-centric repo for now.

### Tools

Currently using:

- Ruby 2.7.6
- Rails 6.0.5

I chose these older versions as I learn. There is a ton of content out there for Rails 6 and I'd rather lean on that for now. Once I have a better handle on the language and the framework, I can play around with a different app on newer versions.
